# Engine documentation
## Preface

It has recently occurred to me that the engine is now in the state where it can be used to create a complete, albeit rudimentary game. Additionally, several features have been added to the engine, but haven't been used in the current storyline -- thus making them undocumented and hidden from a potential developer. As such, I decided to write some documentation for anyone who decides to give developing a game with this engine a hand. Good luck.


## The basics

The engine is designed to completely separate the code for the storyline, and the engine code itself, thus somewhat abstracting the developer from the difficult part. To simplify the process enough to where a developer wouldn't need a visual editor to create a game, I've opted to use JSON arrays to represent game data. Every scene is a JSON object in an array within a file. Every file represents a branch in your story.

### TODO:
- finish docs lol
