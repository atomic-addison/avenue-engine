# Engine documentation
## Preface

It has recently occurred to me that the engine is now in the state where it can be used to create a complete, albeit rudimentary game. Additionally, several features have been added to the engine, but haven't been used in the current storyline -- thus making them undocumented and hidden from a potential developer. As such, I decided to write some documentation for anyone who decides to give developing a game with this engine a hand. Good luck.
